## Hands-On with Python: Exercises 1 
- Generate 200 data points between 0 and 30 from uniform distribution
- Set intercept and slope to values of your choice $`y_true = intercept + slope x`$


## Homework 1
- Create a python function that computes a design matrix using NumPy.

## Homework 2
- Create a python class that computes (i) design matrix, (ii) learning parameters of a linear model, (iii) and plotting the results.
- Your class should have three methods for each of the three above tasks. 

## Practical Assignment 1
Create a python class with the following objectives: <br>
- A method for creating a design matrix for a feature vector x
- A method for learning the parameters of the model
- A method for predicting target values given input values x using two methods:
    - Ã“LS
    - MLE
 - A plotting method for a fitted line and 1 standard division for denoting uncertainties with the MLE method.
 - Your class should allow the user to specify a method of interest e.g. "OLS" or "MLE"

## Practical Assignment 2
Create a python class that performs machine learning tasks described below: <br>
- Create methods that allow a user to build models using Polynomial Regression.
- A user should be able to specify a degree of a polynomial.
- For training the models, use a close form solution/normal equation. 
- Your learning method should allow the user to choose to regularize a model.

## Practical Assignment 3
Read the paper titled `Clustering Cloud Workloads: K-Means vs Gaussian Mixture Model` and implement the comparison of the K-means and Gaussian Mixture Model(GMM). <br>

## Practical Assignment 4
Implement a Gaussian Processes Regress from the first principle to find functions that model the relationship between the following:<br>
- x = [0, 0.1, 2, 4] & y = [4, 0.9, 3.6, 5]

## Practical Assignment 5
Write a probabilistic programme in pymc3 which implements a Gaussian Processes Regress to find functions that model the relationship between the following.<br>
- x = [0, 0.1, 2, 4] & y = [4, 0.9, 3.6, 5]
